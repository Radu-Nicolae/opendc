# M3SA

Datacenters are vital for the digital society and represent a considerable fraction of global energy consumption,
estimated between 1\% and 2\%, and are expected to rise to 8\% by 2030, further reducing already over-exploited
resources. In the operations of every datacenter, simulators play a crucial role in predicting the capabilities of real
or virtual infrastructure, under various workloads.

We propose M3SA, a tool for ICT simulation analysis, using multi-model techniques. We argue that, albeit still valuable,
the development of individual simulation models is insufficient to make accurate predictions. This concept has been
implemented in other scientific fields and yielded impactful results, yet marks a pioneer in the realm of Computer
Science.

This can pioneer a new stage in the sub-field of cloud-infrastructure simulations, a significant simulation advancement,
and hence a considerable improvement in datacenter infrastructure development, scaling, and _massivizing_.
