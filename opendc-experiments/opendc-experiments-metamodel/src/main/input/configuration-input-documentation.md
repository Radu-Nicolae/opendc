# Documentation for the configuration input file

## Topology count
- Possible values: any integer greater than 0
- Description: This represents how many topologies / configuration will we have in the simulator. The number of topologies, represents how many columns will we further read.
- Example: TopologyCount = 3 means we'll have 3 topologies, and we will read the following 3 columns.

## Topology
- Possible values: string that matches file name with the topology configuration
- <b>Current possible values</b>: multi / single
- Description: We have the topology configured in a file. We take from this column, a topology name. Based on that name, the simulator knows what pre-built topology to select.
- Example: multi => will take from multi.txt 

## Failure frequency
- Possible values: any integer between 0.0 - 1.0
- <b>Current possible values</b>: any - we don't handle yet
- Description: This represents the frequency of failures in the simulator.
- Example: 0.5 => 50% of the time, a failure will occur

## Allocation Policy
- Possible values:
  - "mem" 
  - "mem-inv"
  - "core-mem"
  - "core-mem-inv"
  - "active-servers"
  - "active-servers-inv"
  - "random"
- Description: This represents the allocation policy / scheduler that will be used in the simulator.
- Example: mem => will use the mem allocation policy

## Metrics to analyze
- Possible Values
  - cpu_limit
  - cpu_usage
  - cpu_demand,
  - cpu_utilization
  - cpu_time_active
  - cpu_time_idle
  - power_total
- Description: This represents the metrics that will be analyzed in the simulator. 
  - X-axis: time
  - Y-axis: metric value
- Example: cpu_limit => will analyze the cpu_limit metric

## Folder output name
- Possible values: [OPTIONAL] if desired, any string, without spaces and special characters (only letters, numbers, - and _)
- Description: can be left empty, this way the simulator will generate inside a folder that has the current date: yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss
- Example: my-simulation => will generate a folder with the name my-simulation
- Example2: nothing => will generate a folder with the name e.g., 2024-01-07-13-47-23
